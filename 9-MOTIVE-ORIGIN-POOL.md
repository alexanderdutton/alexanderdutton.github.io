## Motive Distribution Analysis

### Which Motives Are Represented?

| Motive | Strong Biases (×1.5+) | Origins With Bias | Total Influence |
|---------|---------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Wealth | 9 | CEO, Startup Founder, etc. | High |
| Power | 6 | CEO, Crime Boss, Police Officer | Medium |
| Love | 6 | Stay-at-Home Parent, Nanny, Nurse | Medium |
| Social | 12 | Teacher, Bartender, etc. | Very High |
| Knowledge | 8 | Librarian, Professor, Scientist | High |
| Excellence | 25 | Martial Artist, Athlete, Craftsman | Very High |
| Justice | 7 | Police Officer, Activist, etc. | High |
| Tradition | 1 | Secret Heir | Low |
| Freedom | 11 | Wandering Drifter, Digital Nomad | Very High |

**Balance:** Excellence and Freedom are well-represented. Tradition is sparse but represented in Rare tier. All motives have coverage.

## How Probability Works

### Stage 1: Roll Rarity Tier

**Random selection weighted by tier probability:**
- 60% chance → Common origin pool (36 origins)
- 35% chance → Uncommon origin pool (21 origins)
- 5% chance → Rare origin pool (3 origins)

### Stage 2: Apply Motive Multipliers

Within selected pool, calculate each origin's probability:

```
base_weight = origin.weight
multiplier = product of (motive_strength × motive_bias) for matching motives
final_weight = base_weight × multiplier
```

**Example: Character with High Wealth (0.9) + High Power (0.8)**

**CEO (Rare, Weight 2):**
- Biases: Wealth ×2.5, Power ×2.5
- Multiplier: (0.9 × 2.5) × (0.8 × 2.5) = 2.25 × 2.0 = 4.5
- Final weight: 2 × 4.5 = **9.0**

**Crime Boss (Rare, Weight 1):**
- Biases: Wealth ×2.0, Power ×2.5
- Multiplier: (0.9 × 2.0) × (0.8 × 2.5) = 1.8 × 2.0 = 3.6
- Final weight: 1 × 3.6 = **3.6**

**Result:** CEO is ~2.5x more likely than Crime Boss for this character.

**Example: Character with High Freedom (0.9) + High Excellence (0.8)**

**Wandering Drifter (Uncommon, Weight 1):**
- Biases: Freedom ×2.0, Excellence ×1.2
- Multiplier: (0.9 × 2.0) × (0.8 × 1.2) = 1.8 × 0.96 = 1.73
- Final weight: 1 × 1.73 = **1.73**

**Digital Nomad (Uncommon, Weight 2):**
- Biases: Freedom ×2.0, Knowledge ×1.2, Wealth ×1.1
- Multiplier: (0.9 × 2.0) × (0.5 × 1.2) × (0.6 × 1.1) = 1.8 × 0.6 × 0.66 = 0.71
- Final weight: 2 × 0.71 = **1.42**

**Result:** Wandering Drifter slightly more likely than Digital Nomad for this character.

## Motive Strength Scale

| Strength | Value | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Very Low | 0.0 - 0.2 | Weak motivation |
| Low | 0.2 - 0.4 | Below average |
| Average | 0.4 - 0.6 | Typical person |
| High | 0.6 - 0.8 | Strong motivation |
| Very High | 0.8 - 1.0 | Defining trait |

---

## Example Character Generation

**Character: High Wealth (0.9), High Power (0.8), Average others (0.5)**

### Step 1: Roll Rarity
- Roll: 72 → Uncommon origin pool

### Step 2: Calculate Weights

| Origin | Base Weight | Multiplier Calculation | Final Weight |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|--------------|
| Startup Founder | 2 | (0.9×2.0) × (0.8×1.5) × (0.5×1.4) = 1.8 × 1.2 × 0.7 = 1.51 | 3.02 |
| Freelance Developer | 2 | (0.9×1.3) × (0.5×1.6) × (0.5×1.6) = 1.17 × 0.8 × 0.8 = 0.75 | 1.50 |
| Wandering Drifter | 1 | (0.5×2.0) × (0.5×1.2) = 1.0 × 0.6 = 0.6 | 0.60 |
| Rising Gang Leader | 1 | (0.9×1.5) × (0.8×1.6) × (0.5×1.3) = 1.35 × 1.28 × 0.65 = 1.12 | 1.12 |
| Political Aide | 1 | (0.5×1.5) × (0.8×1.5) × (0.5×1.4) = 0.75 × 1.2 × 0.7 = 0.63 | 0.63 |
| Community Organizer | 1 | (0.5×1.8) × (0.5×1.6) × (0.5×1.2) = 0.9 × 0.8 × 0.6 = 0.43 | 0.43 |

### Step 3: Select Origin
- Startup Founder: 3.02 (32%)
- Freelance Developer: 1.50 (16%)
- Rising Gang Leader: 1.12 (12%)
- Other origins: < 1.0

**Most likely:** Startup Founder

## Implementation Notes

### Data Structure (Python)

```python
@dataclass
class Origin:
    title: str
    rarity: str  # "common", "uncommon", "rare"
    motive_biases: Dict[str, float]  # {"wealth": 2.5, "power": 2.5}
    weight: int

ORIGIN_POOL = {
    "common": [
        Origin("Teacher", "common", {"social": 1.5}, 3),
        Origin("Retail Worker", "common", {}, 2),
        # ... 34 more
    ],
    "uncommon": [
        Origin("Startup Founder", "uncommon", {"wealth": 2.0, "power": 1.5, "excellence": 1.5}, 2),
        Origin("Wandering Drifter", "uncommon", {"freedom": 2.0}, 1),
        # ... 19 more
    ],
    "rare": [
        Origin("CEO", "rare", {"wealth": 2.5, "power": 2.5, "excellence": 2.0}, 2),
        Origin("Crime Boss", "rare", {"wealth": 2.0, "power": 2.5}, 1),
        Origin("Secret Heir", "rare", {"wealth": 2.5, "power": 1.5, "tradition": 1.5}, 2)
    ]
}
```

### Selection Algorithm

```python
import random

def select_origin(character_motives: Dict[str, float]) -> Origin:
    # Stage 1: Roll rarity tier
    rarity_roll = random.random()
    if rarity_roll < 0.60:
        tier = "common"
    elif rarity_roll < 0.95:  # 0.60 + 0.35
        tier = "uncommon"
    else:
        tier = "rare"

    # Stage 2: Calculate weighted probabilities within tier
    candidates = ORIGIN_POOL[tier]
    weights = []

    for origin in candidates:
        multiplier = 1.0
        for motive, bias in origin.motive_biases.items():
            motive_strength = character_motives.get(motive, 0.5)
            multiplier *= motive_strength * bias
        weights.append(origin.weight * multiplier)

    # Stage 3: Weighted random selection
    return random.choices(candidates, weights=weights, k=1)[0]
```

## Summary

**60 Origins, 9 Motives, Probabilistic Correlation**

- **Common** (36 origins): Everyday backgrounds, mild motive bias
- **Uncommon** (21 origins): Distinctive backgrounds, moderate motive bias
- **Rare** (3 origins): Memorable backgrounds, strong motive bias
- **No low multipliers**: Only positive motive boosts
- **No lock-in**: Motives influence probability, but any origin is possible

**Result:** Diverse, nuanced characters with emergent personality from background and motivation.

**Status:** Design complete, ready for implementation.
