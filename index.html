  <h2>Recent Work</h2>
<div class="case-study">
  <h3>Client X had critical bug</h3>
  <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Production site had a recurring login glitch that was annoying and difficult to reliably reproduce. Staff had been delayed from regular duties while trying to resolve it.</p>
  <p><strong>Solution:</strong> I acessed the codebase myself, ran through the workflow, isolated the possibilities, and deployed a hotfix within hours.</p>
  <p><strong>Result:</strong> Staff freed up to return to regular development. No more stress.</p>
  <p><strong>How I did it:</strong> Scaled down the code in a test environment, reintroduced elements until the glitch began appearing, and targeted the plugin responsible. The plugin was essential, so we developed a functional workaround and could resolve the issue quickly.</p>
